abstract: 
In 2016 the Panama Canal doubled its throughput capacity. Routing choices of East Asian imports to the and within the United States were impacted. I construct a dataset which combines features of international shipping with patterns of U.S. internal trade across several years, varied regions, and multiple products. I quantify and decompose the effects of the Panama Canal Expansion on U.S. East Asian imports using difference-in-difference estimation: total traffic increased by 18% and routes to East Coast ports and through the Panama Canal gained market share at the expense of competing regions and routes. Changes to internal trade are driven by trade-offs between product-specific reductions in per-unit transportation costs and increases in inventory costs. The port of New York accounts for more than 60% of total cost savings post Canal Expansion. Total product transportation cost savings factor out to about 45 billion USD.
