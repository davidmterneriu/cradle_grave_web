    description: 'The Phillip Saunders Award is given to the best introductory economics associate instructor in the department. It is named in honor of Professor Saunders who served as the faculty coordinator of our large, multi-section introductory courses from 1971 to 1998, except for the four years he served as department chair.

This award goes to the best introductory economics associate instructor in the department.  In addition to the strong performance their students have demonstrated on departmental finals, their students routinely comment on the strength of their teaching abilities and the valuable experiences they have had in their classroom.'
