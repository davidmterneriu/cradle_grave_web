# First post thoughts

Throughout the year, I come across interesting datasets that are ripe for story telling but that are without an obvious research dimension/question. This portion of the website is dedicated to sharing the first inklings that come to mind after sorting through and trying to glean a pattern (or two) from the data. 

# You say tomato, I say tomato?

[Hillbilly Elegy](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/hillbilly-elegy-j-d-vance?variant=32207704391714) is a highly readable, personal memoir detailing author [J.D. Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance)'s journey from/through a Appalachian (broken) community on to Yale Law School. The book was initially held in wide esteem, particularly among *The Atlantic* devotees, for providing a glimpse into the often inscrutable (to outsiders) class of voters who helped to elect Donald Trump. In response to the book's appeal and commercial success (*New York Times* Best Seller List 2016-2017), director [Ron Howard](https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/ron-howard-to-direct-produce-hillbilly-elegy-movie-123741/) partnered with Netflix to adapt J.D.'s story for a full length motion picture. Given the source material, the choice of director, the talents of [Amy Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Adams) and [Glenn Close ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Close), and a musical score by [Hans Zimmer](https://filmmusicreporter.com/2020/03/10/hans-zimmer-to-reteam-with-ron-howard-on-hillbilly-elegy/), the film appeared poised for future success. 

It was not to be. Well, defining <u>success</u> for which <u>kind</u> of audience is a matter of keen interest, and Rotten Tomatoes helps us get at measurement questions.  


[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) (RT hereafter) is review-aggregation website where users can rate and review both movies and television shows. RT reviewers fall into two camps: critics and (general) audience. "Critics" typically belong to: writing guilds, film critic associations, and/or major newspapers whereas "Audience" reviews come from any/all RT users with an RT account. 

RT's [reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hillbilly_elegy) of Hillbilly Elegy are decidedly polarized: critics panned the same film general audience members loved: 
![Hillbilly Elegey RT page](index.en_files/figure-html/rot_tot.png)
In other words, general audience members on average rated Hillbilly Elegy about 60 percentage points higher than critics... quite a difference in opinion. Taking a cursory glance at Top Critic reviews suggests something a through line that unifies Top Critic feedback: an aversion to not only artistic sensibilities but to the film's political undertones:

Seeing this discrepancy brought to mind both: (1) other RT titles where Critics and Audience members held strongly opposed views --- see [Star Wars: The Last Jedi](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi) where Critics rated the film at 90% to the Audience's 42% --- and (2) growing evidence of [media consumption differences](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html) as a part of larger political/cultural polarization trends. 

With all of this background in mind, I assembled a dataset to help answer the following questions: 

* Do Rotten Tomatoes Reviews evidence systematic film-taste differences between cultural elites (e.g. Critics Audience Reviews) and general audiences (e.g. Audience Reviews)? 
* Are taste differences growing over time? If so, in which direction? 
* What are the box office implications of producing films which divide Critics and Audience members? 


In later versions of the page, I will spell out the details of the dataset creation. At a high level, all I did was: first, web-scrape Wikipedia for all American films made annually between 1920-2020; second web-scrape Rotten Tomatoes for Critic/Audience scores; and, third, web-scrape [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home) for information about the film (e.g. box office gross world wide and in the US, operating budget, director, etc). Web scraping was performed using R's `rvest` library. All said and done, the final web-scraped/merged dataset has about a 8,900 movies across the past century (1920-2020) of American film.
