<h1>First post thoughts</h1>
<p>Throughout the year, I come across interesting datasets that are ripe for story telling but that are without an obvious research dimension/question. This portion of the website is dedicated to sharing the first inklings that come to mind after sorting through and trying to glean a pattern (or two) from the data.</p>

<h1>You say tomato, I say tomato?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/hillbilly-elegy-j-d-vance?variant=32207704391714">Hillbilly Elegy</a> is a highly readable, personal memoir detailing author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance">J.D. Vance</a>’s journey from/through a Appalachian (broken) community on to Yale Law School. The book was initially held in wide esteem, particularly among <em>The Atlantic</em> devotees, for providing a glimpse into the often inscrutable (to outsiders) class of voters who helped to elect Donald Trump. In response to the book’s appeal and commercial success (<em>New York Times</em> Best Seller List 2016-2017), director <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/ron-howard-to-direct-produce-hillbilly-elegy-movie-123741/">Ron Howard</a> partnered with Netflix to adapt J.D.’s story for a full length motion picture. Given the source material, the choice of director, the talents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Adams">Amy Adams</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Close">Glenn Close</a>, and a musical score by <a href="https://filmmusicreporter.com/2020/03/10/hans-zimmer-to-reteam-with-ron-howard-on-hillbilly-elegy/">Hans Zimmer</a>, the film appeared poised for future success.</p>
<p>It was not to be. Well, defining <u>success</u> for which <u>kind</u> of audience is a matter of keen interest, and Rotten Tomatoes helps us get at measurement questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (RT hereafter) is review-aggregation website where users can rate and review both movies and television shows. RT reviewers fall into two camps: critics and (general) audience. “Critics” typically belong to: writing guilds, film critic associations, and/or major newspapers whereas “Audience” reviews come from any/all RT users with an RT account.</p>
<p>RT’s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hillbilly_elegy">reviews</a> of Hillbilly Elegy are decidedly polarized: critics panned the same film general audience members loved:

In other words, general audience members on average rated Hillbilly Elegy about 60 percentage points higher than critics… quite a difference in opinion. Taking a cursory glance at Top Critic reviews suggests something a through line that unifies Top Critic feedback: an aversion to not only artistic sensibilities but to the film’s political undertones:</p>

<p>Seeing this discrepancy brought to mind both: (1) other RT titles where Critics and Audience members held strongly opposed views — see <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</a> where Critics rated the film at 90% to the Audience’s 42% — and (2) growing evidence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html">media consumption differences</a> as a part of larger political/cultural polarization trends.</p>
<p>With all of this background in mind, I assembled a dataset to help answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do Rotten Tomatoes Reviews evidence systematic film-taste differences between cultural elites (e.g. Critics Audience Reviews) and general audiences (e.g. Audience Reviews)?</li>
<li>Are taste differences growing over time? If so, in which direction?</li>
<li>What are the box office implications of producing films which divide Critics and Audience members?</li>
</ul>
<p>In later versions of the page, I will spell out the details of the dataset creation. At a high level, all I did was: first, web-scrape Wikipedia for all American films made annually between 1920-2020; second web-scrape Rotten Tomatoes for Critic/Audience scores; and, third, web-scrape <a href="https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home">IMDb</a> for information about the film (e.g. box office gross world wide and in the US, operating budget, director, etc). Web scraping was performed using R’s <code>rvest</code> library. All said and done, the final web-scraped/merged dataset has about a 8,900 movies across the past century (1920-2020) of American film.</p>
